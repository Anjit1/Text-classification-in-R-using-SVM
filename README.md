# Text-classification-in-R-using-SVM
Project on text classification in R

I have used Rstudio for this. One can just run svm_train.r and svm_test.r script in Rstudio for output. 
For package installation : install.packages("package_names")

For execution in command prompt, refer to file inside command_prompt.
